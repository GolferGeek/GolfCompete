# Phase 4 Implementation Plan: Invitation & Participation Management System

## Overview

Phase 4 focuses on implementing a comprehensive invitation and participation management system for the Golf Compete application. This phase will establish the infrastructure and user flows for inviting users to series and events, handling participation requests, and ensuring a seamless onboarding experience for new users who have been invited to competitions.

## Goals

- Create a robust invitation system with unique tokens and email integration
- Implement multiple participation flows (direct invites, join requests, auto-enrollment)
- Develop admin tools for managing participants and invitations
- Build a notification system for invitations and status changes
- Implement comprehensive E2E testing for all invitation and participation flows

## Timeline

- Estimated Duration: 1-2 weeks
- Start Date: [TBD]
- Target Completion: [TBD]

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Invitation Infrastructure

#### Tasks:
- Design and implement the invitations table in Supabase
- Create invitation token generation and validation system
- Implement invitation status workflow (pending, accepted, declined, expired)
- Design email templates for series and event invitations
- Build API endpoints for creating and managing invitations

#### Technical Considerations:
- Use secure, unique tokens for each invitation
- Implement proper expiration handling for invitations
- Design flexible schema to support both series and event invitations
- Ensure proper error handling for invitation processes
- Create reusable components for invitation management

### 2. User Participation Flows

#### Tasks:
- Implement direct invitation flow
  - Admin sends email invites to specific users
  - Email delivery with invitation links
  - Invitation acceptance/rejection process
- Create join request system for public series/events
  - UI for users to discover and request to join series/events
  - Admin approval/rejection workflow
  - Status notifications for users
- Develop auto-enrollment for new users
  - Hook into authentication flow to check for pending invitations
  - Automatically add new users to series/events they were invited to
  - Welcome experience for new users with pending invitations

#### Technical Considerations:
- Design intuitive UX for different participation flows
- Implement proper validation and security checks
- Handle edge cases (e.g., expired invitations, duplicate requests)
- Create clear status indicators for users throughout the process

### 3. Admin Management Tools

#### Tasks:
- Build UI for sending individual and bulk invitations
  - Email address input with validation
  - Series/event selection
  - Optional personalized message
- Create dashboard for managing join requests

  - Approve/reject actions with batch operations
  - Filtering and sorting capabilities
- Implement participant status management
  - View and edit participant statuses
  - Bulk operations for status changes
  - Participant history and activity tracking
- Add configuration options for series/events
  - Public/private visibility settings
  - Auto-approval options for join requests
  - Invitation expiration settings

#### Technical Considerations:
- Design efficient UI for handling large numbers of participants
- Implement proper permission checks for admin actions
- Create intuitive workflows for common admin tasks
- Add confirmation steps for critical actions

### 4. Notification System

#### Tasks:
- Implement email notifications
  - Invitation emails with secure links

  - Notification preferences and settings
  - Mark as read/unread functionality

#### Technical Considerations:
- Design mobile-friendly email templates
- Implement proper email delivery tracking
- Create a scalable notification architecture
- Add user preferences for notification frequency

### 5. End-to-End Testing

#### Tasks:
- Develop E2E tests for invitation flows
  - Test sending invitations to existing users
  - Test invitations to new users (signup + auto-enrollment)
  - Verify email delivery and link functionality
- Create tests for join request workflow
  - Test requesting to join public series/events
  - Verify admin approval/rejection process
  - Test status notifications
- Implement tests for admin management tools
  - Test bulk invitation sending
  - Verify participant management functions
  - Test configuration changes

#### Technical Considerations:
- Create test users with unique identifiers
- Implement proper test isolation
- Design tests that follow real user journeys
- Add comprehensive cleanup procedures

## Dependencies

- Completion of Phase 3 (Core Admin Setup)
- Supabase project with authentication configured
- Email delivery service integration
- Material UI components library
- Playwright testing framework

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Email delivery issues | High | Implement proper error handling, retry logic, and delivery tracking |
| Security vulnerabilities in invitation links | High | Use secure tokens with expiration, validate user identity on acceptance |
| Poor user experience for new users | Medium | Design clear onboarding flow, provide context in invitation emails |
| Scalability issues with bulk invitations | Medium | Implement batch processing, rate limiting, and proper indexing |
| Notification overload | Low | Add user preferences, group similar notifications, prioritize important ones |
| Test data pollution | Medium | Implement robust cleanup procedures, use unique identifiers for test entities |
| Email spam filters | Medium | Follow email best practices, use proper authentication (SPF, DKIM) |

## Success Criteria

- Users can be invited to series and events via email
- New users are automatically enrolled in series/events they were invited to
- Admins can efficiently manage participants and invitations
- Users receive timely notifications about invitations and status changes
- All E2E tests pass consistently
- The system handles edge cases gracefully (expired invitations, duplicate requests, etc.)

## Next Steps After Completion

Upon successful completion of Phase 4, the project will move to Phase 5: Season-Long Competition Mechanics, which will focus on implementing the FedEx Cup-style points system, leaderboards, and multi-event progression.

## Future Enhancements (Post Phase 4)

- Social sharing for invitations
- Integration with calendar systems (Google Calendar, iCal)
- Advanced analytics for invitation conversion rates
- Automated reminder system for pending invitations
- Group/team invitations for tournaments
