Summary

These 10 phases will guide your development from initial setup to a fully featured GolfCompete application. Each phase is intentionally broad, allowing you to create the detailed technical tasks, database migrations, and E2E test steps within each. You may find that some of these phases can be split or combined depending on your team size or workflow, but this structure ensures a logical progression from the foundation to advanced features.
