# Phase 2 Implementation Plan: Authentication & User Management

## Overview

Phase 2 of the Golf Compete application focuses on implementing a comprehensive authentication system and user management features. This phase establishes the foundation for user accounts, profiles, and secure access to the application.

## Completed Components

### Authentication System

- [x] Supabase integration for authentication
- [x] Email/password authentication
- [x] Google OAuth authentication
- [x] Password reset functionality
- [x] Authentication context provider
- [x] Protected routes implementation

### User Pages

- [x] Login page
- [x] Signup page
- [x] Password reset request page
- [x] Password reset confirmation page
- [x] OAuth callback handler
- [x] User onboarding flow
- [x] User profile management
- [x] Dashboard page (basic implementation)

### Database Structure

- [x] Profiles table with Row Level Security
- [x] User creation trigger and function

## Next Steps

### 1. Equipment Management (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] Create database schema for golf clubs and bags
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for equipment
- [ ] Design and implement equipment management UI
- [ ] Add equipment selection to user profiles

### 2. Competition Management (2-3 weeks)

- [ ] Design competition data model
- [ ] Create competition creation and management pages
- [ ] Implement competition joining functionality
- [ ] Design leaderboard and results pages

### 3. Scoring System (2-3 weeks)

- [ ] Design scoring data model
- [ ] Implement score entry forms
- [ ] Create score validation logic
- [ ] Design score history and statistics pages

### 4. Social Features (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] Implement friend/connection system
- [ ] Create activity feed
- [ ] Add notifications for competition events
- [ ] Design and implement messaging system

## Technical Debt & Improvements

- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for authentication flows
- [ ] Implement E2E tests for user journeys
- [ ] Optimize database queries and add indexes
- [ ] Implement proper error handling throughout the application
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring for authentication events
- [ ] Improve form validation and user feedback

## Deployment Considerations

- [ ] Set up production environment variables
- [ ] Configure Supabase for production
- [ ] Implement proper CORS and security headers
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
