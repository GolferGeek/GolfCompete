# Phase 3 Implementation Plan: Core Admin Setup (Courses, Series, Events)

## Overview

Phase 3 focuses on implementing the core administrative features of the Golf Compete application, specifically the management of courses, series, and events. This phase will establish the foundation for organizing golf competitions by creating the necessary data structures and user interfaces for administrators to create and manage these essential components.

## Goals

- Implement admin role and permission system
- Create comprehensive course management functionality
- Develop series management for organizing multi-event competitions
- Build event management system with participant tracking
- Implement comprehensive E2E testing for all admin flows

## Timeline

- Estimated Duration: 2-3 weeks
- Start Date: [TBD]
- Target Completion: [TBD]

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Admin Role & Permissions System

#### Tasks:
- Design and implement admin role flag in user profiles
- Create admin dashboard/portal with restricted access
- Implement middleware for protecting admin routes
- Add admin user management interface
- Create admin user invitation system
- Implement role-based UI rendering

#### Technical Considerations:
- Use Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) for enforcing permissions
- Implement proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts
- Create reusable admin components (tables, forms, filters)
- Design scalable permission system for future role types

### 2. Course Management

#### Tasks:
- Design Supabase table schema for golf courses
  - Basic course information (name, location, address)
  - Course details (slope, rating, par)
  - Multiple tee box options
- Create course creation/edit form
- Implement course listing with search and filtering
- Add course deletion with proper validation
- Design and implement tee box management
  - Multiple tee options per course (championship, men's, women's, etc.)
  - Tee-specific data (distance, rating, slope)
- Create hole-by-hole data structure
  - Par values for each hole
  - Distances for each hole from different tees
  - Handicap values for each hole

#### Technical Considerations:
- Design flexible schema to support future course-related features
- Implement proper validation for course data
- Consider performance for courses with multiple tee options
- Add sorting/filtering capabilities for course listings
- Implement map integration for course location (optional)

### 3. Series Management

#### Tasks:
- Design database schema for series
  - Series details (name, description, start/end dates)
  - Series type (season-long, match play, etc.)
  - Series rules and scoring system
- Create series CRUD operations
- Implement series listing with filtering options
- Design and develop UI for series management
- Add functionality to assign users to series
  - Series participants management
  - Series administrators management
- Implement series status tracking (upcoming, active, completed)

#### Technical Considerations:
- Design schema to support different types of series competitions
- Implement proper validation for series data
- Consider performance for series with many participants
- Add sorting/filtering capabilities for series listings
- Ensure proper relationships between series and events

### 4. Event Management

#### Tasks:
- Design database schema for events
  - Event details (name, date, course, format)
  - Event status (upcoming, in progress, completed)
  - Event scoring system
- Create event CRUD operations
- Implement event listing with filtering options
- Design and develop UI for event management
- Add functionality to assign participants to events
- Create relationship between events and series
- Implement standalone event option (not part of a series)
- Design basic event results tracking

#### Technical Considerations:
- Design schema to support different types of event formats
- Implement proper validation for event data
- Consider performance for events with many participants
- Add sorting/filtering capabilities for event listings
- Ensure proper relationships between events, series, and courses

### 5. End-to-End Testing

#### Tasks:
- Extend E2E testing strategy to include admin functionality
- Create test admin user creation and management utilities
- Implement full admin lifecycle testing:
  - Admin user creation and permissions
  - Course creation, editing, and deletion
  - Series creation, editing, and deletion
  - Event creation, editing, and deletion
  - Participant assignment to series and events
- Create reusable test data for courses, series, and events
- Implement comprehensive cleanup procedures
- Design tests that follow real admin user journeys

#### Technical Considerations:
- Continue using Playwright for E2E testing with real data (no mocks)
- Create dedicated test admin users with unique identifiers
- Implement proper test isolation while maintaining test data relationships
- Develop utilities to track and clean up all admin-created entities
- Structure tests to build upon each other (e.g., later tests use entities created in earlier tests)
- Ensure tests can run in CI/CD environments with proper setup/teardown

### 6. Test Data Management

#### Tasks:
- Extend test data generation utilities for admin entities
- Implement database seeding for courses, series, and events
- Design cascading deletion strategies for test data
- Create admin utilities for test data management
- Implement data verification steps in tests

#### Technical Considerations:
- Balance between test isolation and test efficiency
- Track relationships between created entities for proper cleanup
- Implement safeguards to prevent accidental deletion of non-test data
- Create logging and monitoring for test data creation/deletion

|------|--------|------------|
| Complex course data structure | Medium | Careful database design, thorough testing of relationships |
| Series-event relationship complexity | Medium | Clear documentation, proper database constraints |
| Admin permission security vulnerabilities | High | Regular security audits, follow best practices for permissions |
| Performance issues with large datasets | Medium | Optimize queries, implement pagination, use proper indexes |
| User experience friction in admin flows | Medium | Usability testing, clear error messages, streamlined forms |
| Test data pollution | High | Implement robust cleanup procedures, use unique identifiers for test entities |
| Flaky E2E tests | Medium | Design tests with proper waiting and retry mechanisms, implement detailed logging |
| Data integrity issues | High | Implement proper validation, database constraints, and error handling |

## Success Criteria

- Administrators can successfully create, edit, and delete courses
- Administrators can create, edit, and delete series and assign participants
- Administrators can create, edit, and delete events and assign them to series
- All E2E tests pass consistently using real data (no mocks)
- Admin interfaces provide clear feedback and intuitive workflows
- Database schema properly supports all required relationships
- Admin permissions are properly enforced

## Next Steps After Completion
