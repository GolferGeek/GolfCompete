# Phase 2 Implementation Plan: Authentication & User Profile

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on implementing user authentication and profile management using Supabase as the backend service. This phase will establish the foundation for user identity within the Golf Compete application, allowing users to create accounts, manage their profiles, and configure their golf equipment (bags).

## Goals

- Implement secure user authentication with Supabase
- Create intuitive sign-up and login flows
- Develop user profile management functionality
- Establish database structure for user profiles, clubs, and golf bags
- Implement comprehensive E2E testing for all authentication and profile flows

## Timeline

- Estimated Duration: 2-3 weeks
- Start Date: [TBD]
- Target Completion: [TBD]

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Supabase Authentication Setup

#### Tasks:
- Configure Supabase project for authentication
- Set up username/password authentication
- Implement OAuth providers (Google/Gmail)
- Create authentication context provider in React
- Implement token management and secure routing
- Add authentication state persistence

#### Technical Considerations:
- Use Supabase client library for authentication
- Implement proper error handling for auth failures
- Set up secure token storage and refresh mechanisms
- Create protected route middleware/components

### 2. Authentication UI Flows

#### Tasks:
- Design and implement Login page
- Design and implement SignUp page
- Create password reset functionality
- Add authentication links to Navbar
- Implement post-signup onboarding flow

#### Technical Considerations:
- Use Material UI components for form elements
- Implement client-side validation
- Create responsive designs for all auth pages
- Add loading states and error feedback

### 3. User Profile Management

#### Tasks:
- Design Supabase table schema for user profiles
- Implement profile creation on successful signup
- Create profile view/edit pages
- Add fields for:
  - First name
  - Last name
  - Username
  - Handicap
  - Profile picture (optional)
  - Preferences
- Implement profile data validation

#### Technical Considerations:
- Use RLS (Row Level Security) in Supabase for data protection
- Implement optimistic UI updates
- Add proper error handling for profile operations
- Consider caching strategies for profile data

### 4. Club and Bag Management

#### Tasks:
- Design database schema for golf clubs
  - Club types (driver, iron, wedge, putter, etc.)
  - Club specifications (loft, brand, model, etc.)
- Create a club management UI
  - Add/edit/delete club functionality
  - Club categorization and filtering
- Design database schema for golf bags
- Create relationship between users, clubs, and bags
- Implement bag CRUD operations
- Design and develop UI for bag management
- Add functionality to assign clubs to bags
- Create "all clubs" default bag option

#### Technical Considerations:
- Design flexible schema to support future handicap calculations
- Implement proper validation for club data
- Consider performance for users with multiple bags and many clubs
- Add sorting/filtering capabilities for clubs within bags
- Ensure proper relationships between clubs and bags (many-to-many)

### 5. End-to-End Testing

#### Tasks:
- Establish a no-mocking E2E testing strategy
- Create test user creation and management utilities
- Implement full user lifecycle testing:
  - User registration and account creation
  - Profile setup and editing
  - Club creation and management
  - Bag creation and club assignment
  - User account and data cleanup/deletion
- Create reusable test users that persist across test runs
- Implement comprehensive cleanup procedures to remove test data
- Design tests that follow real user journeys through the application

#### Technical Considerations:
- Use Playwright for E2E testing with real data (no mocks)
- Create dedicated test users with unique identifiers
- Implement proper test isolation while maintaining persistent test users
- Develop utilities to track and clean up all user-created entities
- Create a "master cleanup" test that can remove all data associated with test users
- Structure tests to build upon each other (e.g., later tests use entities created in earlier tests)
- Ensure tests can run in CI/CD environments with proper setup/teardown

### 6. Test Data Management

#### Tasks:
- Create test data generation utilities
- Implement database seeding for test environments
- Design cascading deletion strategies for test data
- Create admin utilities for test data management
- Implement data verification steps in tests

#### Technical Considerations:
- Balance between test isolation and test efficiency
- Track relationships between created entities for proper cleanup
- Implement safeguards to prevent accidental deletion of non-test data
- Create logging and monitoring for test data creation/deletion

## Deliverables

   - Functional user signup/login/logout via Supabase
   - Password reset functionality
   - OAuth integration with at least one provider
   - Secure token management

2. **User Profile System**
   - Complete profile management UI
   - Backend data structure in Supabase
   - Profile picture upload functionality
   - Settings and preferences management

3. **Club Management System**
   - Database schema for golf clubs
   - UI for creating and managing clubs
   - Club categorization and filtering

4. **Golf Bag Management**
   - UI for creating and managing multiple bags
   - Club assignment to bags
   - Default "all clubs" option
   - Foundation for future handicap calculations

5. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Comprehensive E2E test suite with real data (no mocks)
   - Test user lifecycle management utilities
   - Test data creation and cleanup procedures
   - API documentation for authentication endpoints
   - User flow documentation
   - Database schema documentation

## Dependencies

- Completion of Phase 1 (Project Initialization & Core Setup)
- Supabase project configuration
- Material UI components library
- Playwright testing framework

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Supabase service disruption | High | Implement fallback authentication, maintain local caching |
| OAuth provider policy changes | Medium | Monitor provider documentation, maintain username/password as backup |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Regular security audits, follow best practices for auth |
| Performance issues with complex queries | Medium | Optimize queries, implement pagination, use proper indexes |
| User experience friction in auth flows | Medium | Usability testing, clear error messages, streamlined forms |
| Complex club-bag relationships | Medium | Careful database design, thorough testing of relationships |
| Test data pollution | High | Implement robust cleanup procedures, use unique identifiers for test entities |
| Flaky E2E tests | Medium | Design tests with proper waiting and retry mechanisms, implement detailed logging |

## Success Criteria

- Users can successfully create accounts and log in
- Profile information can be viewed and edited
- Users can create, edit, and delete golf clubs
- Users can create, edit, and delete golf bags and assign clubs to them
- All E2E tests pass consistently using real data (no mocks)
- Test users can be fully created and deleted with all associated data
- Authentication system is secure and follows best practices
- UI is responsive and provides clear feedback

## Next Steps After Completion

Upon successful completion of Phase 2, the project will move to Phase 3: Core Admin Setup, which will focus on implementing administrative features for managing courses, series, and events.

## Future Enhancements (Post Phase 2)

- Email verification flow
- Account recovery via email
- Multi-factor authentication
- Enhanced security features
- Advanced club statistics and performance tracking
